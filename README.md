# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## *The Goal and Methodology*
### In this analysis we wanted to learn how other theater campaigns performed in achieving their goals.
The things we wanted to know in particular are:
1. How did different campaigns perform grouped by their launch month?
2. What outcomes were achieved based on the campaigns funding goal?

## *Campaign Performance by Month*
### To understand how various theater campaigns performed we first grouped them by their launch date.
What we learned: 
1. Campaigns were wildly more successful that had May launches. 
2. There was also a spike in failed campaings in the month of October. 
These findings would suggest a May start date would be the best timing!
