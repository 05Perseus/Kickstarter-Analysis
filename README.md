# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## *The Goal and Methodology*
### In this analysis we wanted to learn how other theater campaigns performed in achieving their goals.
The things we wanted to know in particular are:
1. How did different campaigns perform grouped by their launch month?
2. What outcomes were achieved based on the campaigns funding goal?
---
## *Campaign Performance by Month*
### To understand how various theater campaigns performed we first grouped them by their launch date.
What we learned: 
1. Campaigns were wildly more successful that had May launches. 
2. There was also a spike in failed campaings in the month of October.
3. There were canceled campaigns every month of the year, except October!

These findings would suggest a May start date would be the best timing to launch your campaign and don't start in October!

## *Campaign Performance by Dollar Goal*
### To further our understanding of the campaign performances we grouped each campaign by their goal. For this analysis, campaigns were grouped by ~$5k from $0 to $50k+.
What we learned:
1. Campaigns with lower than a $20k goal and between $35k-$45 were more likely to be successful.
2. From $20k to $35k and again for campaigns beyond $45k there was a significantly higher likelihood of failure.

Keep the goals low, and you will succeed! Else, find the sweet spot at $40k!
